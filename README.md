# bEbOuNdLeSs-Portfolio

## My Mission

My task this time was to create a simple RESPONSIVE portofolio with the advanced CSS elements that we practiced in week 2. Eventually we will be applying knowledge of JS to bring additional flavor to our protfolios. 

**Note:** I used the advice in the task assignment to use place holder images for projects as I do not have any projects to demonstrate and present at the current moment.

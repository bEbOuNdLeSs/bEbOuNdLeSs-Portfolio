## My Mission

My task this time was to create a simple RESPONSIVE portofolio with the advanced CSS elements that we practiced in week 2. Eventually we will be applying knowledge of JS to bring additional flavor to our protfolios. 

**Note:** I used the advice in the task assignment to use place holder images for projects as I do not have any projects to demonstrate and present at the current moment. 

## Header & Navigation bar

The navigation bar is designed to help the users navigate the website and view specific portions when one of the links are used. The home button is designed to reroute the user back to the top of the page. The navigation bar is also fixed to the top of the browser and will follow the user when scrolling. The links change color when hovered on and underlined. 

The header contains an avatar that I drew previously along with my name and profession.

## About Me
The about me section of this webpage was designed to discuss my three capabilities and my work experience. They are elements that are flexed and will stack in a column when shrunk to the appropriate screen width for accessibility reasons.

## Portfolio
The portfolio section includes images that are used as place holders for projects that I will work on in the future, however it does include a link to the previous homework assignment of code refactoring. The images have a transition when hovered over that brings them closer to the screen and the opacity changes. There is also a flex grid inplace that allows all images to be viewable on the image at all times.

## Contact 
The footer is very standard in comparison to most sites. It contains my contact information with links to my github and linkedin profiles. The email link will automatically open up a window on the userâ€™s pc or mobile device to send an email to me. The links are underlined when hovered over.
